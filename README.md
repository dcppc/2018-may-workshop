## Goals
The goals of the DCPPC May workshop are to build community, to facilitate planned and serendipitous collaboration across teams, and to surface hidden issues around technical and conceptual interoperability.

_We would love_ to have at least 3-5 people from each team and at least 2 people from each of the data stewards. Come join us on May 30-31, share all the great work your team is doing, and be inspired by others in the Commons!
